# changing-colors

This is a simple project to test and demonstrate mouse events in JavaScript. It was created as a refresher to review concepts learned some time ago.

## Installation

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/thiagolehmam/changing-colors.git

## Usage

Open the `changing-colors.html` file in your web browser to view the mouse event tester. The test allows you to click with the left mouse button and create a circle, change the color of the circle by clicking the right button, and increase the radius of the circle by pressing the shift key..

## Concepts Learned

This project covers the following concepts related to mouse events in JavaScript:

- Mouse click events
- Mouse movement events 
- Mouse position and coordinates (`offsetX`, `offsetY`)

By reviewing and experimenting with these concepts, you can gain a better understanding of how mouse events work in JavaScript and how they can be used in your own projects.
